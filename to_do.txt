FOr processes, create header with all prelim info, make static.

Make processing form sequential, make generated report grouped by info type

Make DIN scannable, make receipt and expiration dt scannable, tool tip for manual entry.

Implement child specimens, linked to product, has DIN, component_code, counts fields.

EDIT FORM: have it echo the value previously entered

STANDARDS: NA for all non applicable values

Set 6 hour expiration time on session cookie
Logout button ends session, only use when a process is completely finished.
Anyway to restore $_SESSION after it has ended???

If Browser is closed, how to restore session? 
Implement save button, how does it work?

******Freeze*******
Initialize Process
Valid product, recipient, and other requisite info

******PRE******
Load preliminary product details into form,
Store all accession data, and equipment data at the the beginning
Use timestamp button for all timestamped points, convert to m-d-y H:i for all output

Use <select> to select the tech performing, if not self, flag and require password from tech before proceeding
How do I do this for long periods of time???

Use calc function window to perform all calculations, linked to process by id#, stored in its own table

Otherwise store all data as strings in sql table `processes`

Implement LN2 locations

Once product in LN2 tank, process is in post

******POST******
Report on process, flags can still be unsigned
Child specimens have been created, they are linked to the process, which is linked to a product and recipient
They are stored in their own table `child_specimen` and are linked, they can be created, destroyed and pooled (freeze / thaw)
CANNOT DIRECTLY MANIPULATE CHILD SPECIMENS!!! They can only be interfaced by performing processes

Once all sign offs are performed, process can officially be completed

******COMPLETE******
All signoffs complete, awaiting tech, supervisor, director, QA review
Each reviewer will have access to a button for approval, if there are any concerns, a flag can be created

******Thaw******
Initiate process
Select a product and its daughter specimens

******PRE******
Load preliminary product details into form,
Store all accession data, and equipment data at the the beginning
Use timestamp button for all timestamped points, convert to m-d-y H:i for all output

Pool daughter specimens (if needed), get number from SQ

Use <select> to select the tech performing, if not self, flag and require password from tech before proceeding
How do I do this for long periods of time???

Once product has been issued (in reality), the process proceeds to post

******POST******
Products LN2 locations are freed
Daughter specimens are destroyed

Once all sign offs are performed, process can officially be completed

******COMPLETE******
All signoffs complete, awaiting tech, supervisor, director, QA review
Each reviewer will have access to a button for approval, if there are any concerns, a flag can be created
